# URL-Shortner-FCC-Different
A URL Shortner microservice


This project takes a URL following "http(s)://" format for valid URL and then checks if the url exits or not. It then saves the data on MongoDB database using mongoose, express, node and javascript.
The Project here also checks if the data already exists for the URL entered to avoid duplication.
The project can be further improved to take any type of URL format and save it if it is a valid URL.
